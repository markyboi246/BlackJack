            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without busting 21.</p>
            <h2>Card Values</h2>
                <p>Number Cards are worth Face Value</p>
                <p>King, Queen, and Jackare worth 10</p>
                <p>Aces are worth either 1 or 11</p>
            <h2>Initial Gameplay</h2>
                <p>The game starts by shufflin the cards</p>
                <p>Players are dealt two cards that are both face-up, while the dealer gets one face-up and one face-down.</p>
                <p> Players are able to bet on the game by clicking the amount of chips that they want to place down.</p>
                <p> Players have multiple choices which include:<hr> Hit: Take another card <br> Stand: Keep your current hand <br> Double Down: Double your bet, take one more card, and stand <br> Split: If your first two cards are the same, split them into two separeate hands <hr>
                </p>
                <p>If a player's total exceeds 21, they "Bust" and lose the round.</p>
                <p>Dealer must hit until their total is at least 17.</p>
                <p>The player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealerâ€™s or if the dealer busts.</p>
